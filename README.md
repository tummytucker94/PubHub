# PubHub

PubHub is a self-publishing platform that allows anyone to write, publish, and sell their own books. It is designed to allow users to upload their written works as PDF files, where other users can download those works after paying a fee set by the author. In the next dive, you will download a starter kit. The starter kit is a functional application that you will be able to start and run immediately. The existing functionality is for the Book Publishing System, which handles the creation of new books.
